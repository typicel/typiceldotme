# Hello

I'm a 19 year old software developer from Colorado.

I do all kinds of stuff from web development to computer graphics and more. Anything interesting I do will be put here.

I have experience working with C/C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS/JS, and Python.
I've also used technologies such as ReactJS, Firebase, Cloud Firestore, and PostgreSQL.

I enjoy playing trumpet in my school's marching band, cooking, and playing video games.
