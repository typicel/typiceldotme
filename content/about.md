# Hello

I'm a 20 year old software developer from Colorado.

I like to work with a lot of different technologies, but recently I have been focused on web development and creating great user experiences.

I have experience working with Javascript/Typescript, C/C++, C#, HTML/CSS, and Python.
I've also used technologies such as ReactJS, Firebase, Blazor, ASP.NET, and PostgreSQL.

I play trumpet in my school's marching band, and like to play video games.
